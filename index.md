### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 1 was a favorite of mine because I got to upgrade my original version of the Hi-Lo game into a better draft or attempted to anyway. I had a lot of fun compared to the other labs. I learned that patience is crucial when writing code.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 1 is another favorite of mine because I always wanted to learn how to read words from a file for personal use, so I was excited to learn and apply this to my life to make this so much easier. I also learned that there is not just one way to get things done so I should not be afraid of trying new things.

* Lab 11

    Lab 11, part 1, I enjoyed this lab because it was challenging and allowed us to think like problem solvers. Also, we were learning about animation that day so, as an art fanatic it made me happy and excited, Even if the program does not work properly right now.
